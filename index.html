                    I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                    I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've 
                    been looking to make a transition and have heard some people worthhad an amazing experience here. 
                    I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun!
                    I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best- and most qruelling - time of my life.
                    Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

                    The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. 
                    The program gave me the confidence neccesary to be able to go out in the world and present 
                    myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the 
                    persoanl attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.

                <q>
                    Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line 
                    of code. I needed some structure from professionals 
                    who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged 
                    to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only 
                    say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
                    did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
                    The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level ina way that no tutorial could ever have.
                    In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience.
                    It certainly helped me land a job as a fullistack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!
